  <h1>Stay up to date, with information on important subjects right at your fingertips.</h1>
  <h2>What is on this website?</h2>
  <p>
      The "Say Their Names" page under the BLM button has a list of names of POC who have either
       not recieved justice or who have not been heard. There are petitions and articles under 
       each name.
      I gave a brief summary of BLM and what it stands for, and why saying "all lives matter" is 
      hurtful. 
  <br>
  <br>
      I also included information about the 2020 election and how the electoral college works, 
      which I know can be pretty confusing. I included the two candidates policies and how these 
      policies affect American citizens. 
    <br>
    <br>
      I discussed the blatant racism towards East Asians, and the internet trends that promote it. 
      Islamophobia was another topic I wrote about. These two issues are common and are not talked 
      about often, so I hope you can learn and grow from those pages.
    <br>
    <br>
      I provided some information about COVID-19 as well, mostly the Native Americans that are affected 
      and what will happen if school starts. A donation link is provided to help the Native Americans 
      struggling during this time.
    <br>
    <br>
      Even after legalizing gay marriage in the US, being LGBTQ+ in the US and other countries is still 
      difficult. There is a link to petitions provided as well. 
    <br>
    <br>
      Yemen needs our help. There are 4 donation links available to do your share. I will be adding 
      more information about international problems as well. 
    <br>
    <br>
      Indigenous women have been being killed so frequently in Canada and the US that it has been 
      described as a Canadian national crisis and Canaidan genocide. Do your part and learn more.

  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div class="row">

        <p style="margin-right: 20px;">
            I am 16 years old and a junior in high school. I have been coding for 7 years, and I really 
            enjoy developing websites. 
            <br>
            <br>
            While on social media, I learned a lot about the different issues that are going on in the world 
            right now. It was a lot to take in. This website was created for others to educate 
            themselves on problems that the world is facing and do what they can to help. This website was also created 
            to avoid the spread of misinformation. While making this website, 
            I also gained extensive knowledge on these topics and learned how I can use my voice as well.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <p style="margin-left: 20px">
        Throughout my time learning how to code, I have always had a firm belief that the power of creation should be 
        used for the good of humanity. My primary goal through every single one of my coding projects is to help, educate, or 
        inspire others. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I encourage everyone to use their passions and skills to make a difference in the world, so we 
        can all learn and grow together quickly.
