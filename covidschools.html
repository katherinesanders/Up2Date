    <h1>We experienced a whole school year with COVID.</h1>
    <h2>How did it work?</h2>
    <p>
        Most schools around the US opened in a hybrid format- some students could learn from home, and some could learn at school 
        while wearing a mask. When and if a student were to come down with the virus, they would be required to quarantine for up to 
        2.5 weeks. They would also need to let those they came in contact with know of their state, and urge them to get tested 
        before returning to classes. 
    </p>
    <h2>What will classes look like in the 2021-2022 school year?</h2>
    <p>
        With the release of the vaccine, most schools will be going back to an all in-person system. However, many universities 
        are requiring students to show proof of vaccination. Even students with the vaccine may be told to wear masks due to 
        the rise of new COVID-19 variants, including the delta variant. Although those vaccinated may come down with the virus, 
        the vaccine is not useless. The majority of those vaccinated will not experience any symptoms that will send them to the 
        hospital <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/31/health/fully-vaccinated-people-breakthrough-hospitalization-death/index.html" target="_blank">(CNN)</a>.
