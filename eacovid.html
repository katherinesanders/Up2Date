  <h1>Racism towards East Asians.</h1>
  <h2>Racism towards East Asians has been made quite common since the start of COVID-19.
  </h2> 
  <p>
    COVID-19 started in China and soon spread accross the world to start a world wide pandemic.
    Due to the origin of the disease, East Asians have been treated poorly all across the world. 
    Spat on, shoved, and yelled at are all daily occurences some East Asians had to deal with 
    according to<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52714804"> BBC news</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
      Despite the ignorance of some of these actions, others have decided to stay silent about the 
      issue, and use the "fox eye" trend on social media. The trend is supposed to make your eyes 
      elongated by pulling the corners of the eye back towards the hair line. This trend has been seen
      as offensive towards East Asians because the act of pulling your eyes backward has been used to mock their 
      eye shape.
  </p>
  <p>
      If you are thinking about posting a picture using the fox eye trend, I hope you reconsider after
      learning about the insensitivity of it.
  </p>
  <h2>What can we do?</h2>
    <p>Educate yourself. Call yourself and others out for judging others based on how they look, and keep the conversation
        going.
