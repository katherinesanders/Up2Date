    <h1>Transgender Rights</h1>
    <h2>How are transgender folks treated differently in the US?</h2>
        <p>
            Transgender and Intersex individuals are not getting the education they need in schools.
            <h4><button class="button button1" style="border-color: #6a76a1; color: #6a76a1;" onclick="sameSexPetition()">Click here to sign the petition so we can put Intersex and Transgender education into Sex Ed standards.</button></h4>
        </p>
        <p>Only 18 US states have hate crime laws regarding gender identity. The states that do not are:</p>
        <p>
            Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georiga, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, 
            Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, 
            Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, 
            South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2018, 189 hate crimes against people based on their gender identity. Keep in mind, only 18 states consider 
            gender identity a hate crime, and not all are reported. This number could be much MUCH higher. 
        </p>
