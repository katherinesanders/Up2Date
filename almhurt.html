    <h1>ALM: Why is it hurtful?</h1>
    <h4>ALM stands for "all lives matter." The use of this term started as a comeback to the 
        phrase "black lives matter." Here is why it's racist. 
    </h4>
    <p>Of course; all lives do matter. That's the goal. White lives have always mattered, but 
        black lives haven't been treated like they mattered. Saying "all lives matter" after 
        someone says "black lives matter" takes away the power that statement has. It silences
         the movement.
    </p>
    <h4>Blue Lives Matter</h4>
    <p>
        "Blue lives matter" refers to cops and their lives. However, "blue 
        lives" are only "blue lives" for a certain amount of hours each week. Black folks live in their skin
        24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. They fear discrimination and prejudice every second, yet
         "Blue lives" can take off the uniform.
    </p>
    <h4>What can we do?</h4>
    <p>Educate yourself. Sign petitions. Say their names. Call yourself and others out for racial profiling. 
        Donate, protest,</p>
