    <h1>How did the BLM movement start?</h1>
    <h4>According to Wikipedia:</h4>
      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#:~:text=In%20July%202013%2C%20the%20movement,months%20earlier%2C%20in%20February%202012.">
        In July 2013, the movement began with the use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 
        acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin 17 months earlier, in 
        February 2012. The movement became nationally recognized for street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths 
        of two African Americans: Michael Brown—resulting in protests and unrest in Ferguson Missouri, a city near St. 
        Louis—and Eric Garner in New York City.
    </blockquote>
    <h4>What does it stand for?</h4>
    <p>BLM calls to stop police brutality towards POC, and demanding justice for those who lost their lives due to the racist
        bias the police create. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Police reform is a huge component in recieving justice. The police use excessive force towards non-violent crimes too 
        frequently, and towards blacks more than other races. 
    </p>
    <h4>"But white people are killed by police more often than blacks!"</h4>
    <p>That's true, but the amount of white people and black people in America is far from the same. For every 1 million people,
        31 black people are shot fatally by police. For ever 1 million people, 13 white people are shot fatally by police. 
    </p>
    <h4>ACAB</h4>
    <p>
        ACAB DOES NOT STAND FOR "all cops are bad." ACAB stands for "all cops are bastards." The term "bastards" comes from "bastardise,"
        which can mean corrupt or broken. ACAB does not mean that all cops are terrible people, but they work for a terrible system. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Did you know that the police were originally created to stop slaves from escaping?
    </p>
    <h4>What can we do?</h4>
    <p>Educate yourself. Sign petitions. Say their names. Call yourself and others out for racial profiling. 
        Donate, protest,</p>
