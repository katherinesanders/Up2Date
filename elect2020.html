        <h4>How do these policies affect us?</h4>
        <h5>Woman's right to choose</h5>
        <p>
            Abortion is the act of terminating a pregnancy if the woman is not ready to or fit to 
            care for a child. Not supporting a woman's right to choose takes away the option of 
            abortion.
        </p>
        <h5>Wealth taxes</h5>
        <p>
            Supporting wealth taxes supports taxing the wealthy higher than the lower class, but 
            it is not based on just annual income. It is based on the net worth of a person. Most 
            of the time, the only people who are taxed significantly higher are those with a net 
            worth of over a couple million.
        </p>
        <h5>Cash bail reform</h5>
        <p>
            The cash bail system has been known to ciminalize poverty. People with higher 
            incomes are able to pay the amount given for their bail if they are put in prison. 
        </p>
        <h5>Increasing capital gains tax rate</h5>
        <p>
            Mostly recognized in the stock market, capital gain is the increase of an asset over 
            time. Capital gains go to the highest income households, so a tax on capital gains would 
            make it so less money goes towards those high income households.
        </p>
        <h5>Universal background checks</h5>
        <p>
            Universal background checks are investigations of someone's background if they want to 
            purchase a firearm. 
        </p>
        <h5>Healthcare for all</h5>
        <p>
            Although both candidates disagree on giving free healthcare for all, Joe Biden is interested in finding another way to 
            provide healthcare for those who can't afford it. Health care for all will help lower 
            income familys stay healthy, but will raise taxes for all Americans.
        </p>
        <h5>Climate change</h5>
        <p>DISCLAIMER: BIASED</p>
        <p>
            Climate change is the affect of greenhouse gases on our world. It is backed by science, 
            but Donald Trump still believes it is a hoax. Having a president who believes in climate 
            change will be a good step towards slowing down global warming.
